**Hello, World!**

<div style="text-align: justify">

<p>I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the <a href="https://www.laureateinstitute.org">Laureate Institute for Brain Research</a>, where I work in the laboratory of Dr. Martin Paulus and study the relationship between cannabis use and brain and behavioral health.</p>

<p>I completed my Ph.D at the University of Vermont in the departments of psychiatry, 
and <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/cas/psychology">psychological
science</a>. I worked in the NERVE lab (Neuroimaging Research Vermont) with Dr. Hugh Garavan.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.med.uvm.edu/behaviorandhealth/home">Vermont Center on Behavior and Health</a>, I used human
neuroimaging to study the neural basis of psychiatric problems, with a focus on substance abuse in adolescence.</p>
<p>I have a keen interest in machine learning approaches to neuroimaging research, and have worked on large datasets from the
<a href="https://imagen-europe.com">the IMAGEN project</a>, <a href="http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-addiction-working-
group/">ENIGMA-Addiction</a>, and <a href="https://abcdstudy.org">ABCD.</a></p>
