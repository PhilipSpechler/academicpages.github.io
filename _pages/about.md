Hello, World!


<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a Ph.D student in the department of psychiatry, and [department of psychological science](https://www.uvm.edu/cas/psychology). I work
in the NERVE (NEuRoimaging VErmont) lab with Dr.Hugh Garavan. As part of the [vermont center on beahvior and health]
(http://www.med.uvm.edu/behaviorandhealth/home), I uses neuroimaging to investigate psychatric problems, with a focus on substance abuse
and adolescence.

I have a keen interest in machine learning approaches to neuroimaging research, and have worked on large projects such as the
[IMAGEN project](www.imagen-europe.com), [ENIGMA-Addiction](http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/ongoing/enigma-addiction-working-group/), and [ABCD]
(https://abcdstudy.org).</div>
