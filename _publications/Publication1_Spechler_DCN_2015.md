**Abstract**:
<div style="text-align: justify">Cannabis use in adolescence may be characterized by differences in the neural basis of affective 
processing. In this study, we used an fMRI affective face processing task to compare a large group (n = 70) of 14-year olds with a history 
of cannabis use to a group (n = 70) of never-using controls matched on numerous characteristics including IQ, SES, alcohol and cigarette 
use. The task contained short movies displaying angry and neutral faces. Results indicated that cannabis users had greater reactivity in 
the bilateral amygdalae to angry faces than neutral faces, an effect that was not observed in their abstinent peers. In contrast, activity 
levels in the cannabis users in cortical areas including the right temporal- parietal junction and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex did not discriminate between the two face conditions, but did differ in controls. Results did not change after excluding subjects 
with any psychiatric symptomology. Given the high density of cannabinoid receptors in the amygdala, our findings suggest cannabis use in 
early adolescence is associated with hypersensitivity to signals of threat. Hypersensitivity to negative affect in adolescence may place 
the subject at-risk for mood disorders in adulthood.</div>
