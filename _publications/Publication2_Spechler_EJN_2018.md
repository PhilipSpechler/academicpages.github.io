**Abstract**:
<div style="text-align: justify">Cannabis use initiated during adolescence might precipitate negative consequences in adulthood. Thus, 
predicting adolescent cannabis use prior to any exposure will inform the aetiology of substance abuse by disentangling predictors from 
consequences of use. In this prediction study, data were drawn from the IMAGEN sample, a longitudinal study of adolescence. All selected 
participants (n = 1,581) were cannabis‐naïve at age 14. Those reporting any cannabis use (out of six ordinal use levels) by age 16 were 
included in the outcome group (N = 365, males n = 207). Cannabis‐naïve participants at age 14 and 16 were included in the comparison group 
(N = 1,216, males n = 538). Psychosocial, brain and genetic features were measured at age 14 prior to any exposure. Cross‐validated 
regularized logistic regressions for each use level by sex were used to perform feature selection and obtain prediction error statistics 
on independent observations. Predictors were probed for sex‐ and drug‐specificity using post‐hoc logistic regressions. Models reliably 
predicted use as indicated by satisfactory prediction error statistics, and contained psychosocial features common to both sexes. However, 
males and females exhibited distinct brain predictors that failed to predict use in the opposite sex or predict binge drinking in 
independent samples of same‐sex participants. Collapsed across sex, genetic variation on catecholamine and opioid receptors marginally 
predicted use. Using machine learning techniques applied to a large multimodal dataset, we identified a risk profile containing 
psychosocial and sex‐specific brain prognostic markers, which were likely to precede and influence cannabis initiation.</div>
